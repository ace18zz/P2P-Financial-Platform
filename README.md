# P2P Financial Platform for Investment and Personal Loans

## Project Overview
This project is a financial platform that provides financial services and personal consumption credit services to the general public on the internet. The platform relies on big data wind control technology to offer users convenient, fast, and secure P2P financial services. The project is divided into two parts: the trading platform and the business support.

The trading platform mainly focuses on providing financial services such as the borrowing and lending modules. On the other hand, the business support includes modules such as subject management, reconciliation management, risk control management, among others. The project utilizes advanced internet technology for research and development, ensuring the security, speed, and stability of P2P transactions between the two parties.
